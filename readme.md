Portfolio

This is my personal Portfolio. I use it on my website: `[matysanchez.com](http://matysanchez.com/)`_

Of course you can use this code for your portfolio, o whatever you want.

Just a few lines of PHP code. It's very simple, the pages are located in ``bin/sections/``, if you want to add more, just create a HTML file, and setting the ``index.php``

Remember to config the URL in the file index.html.
 ```php
<?php
// Where the site is hosted?
$url    = "http://localhost/skeleton/"; 
 ```
